# Hi there! 👋

I'm **[Твое Имя]**, a frontend design engineer based in **[Твоя Страна/Город]**.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you'll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing [blog posts](https://твоя-ссылка.com) and sharing tech-related content on social media (over [количество] combined followers and counting).

### Fun Facts:
* ☕ I don't like coffee or tea.
* ⚔️ [Твое любимое аниме/хобби] is my favorite anime.
